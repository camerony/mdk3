MDK3 TODO List

802.11 allows you to fragment each packet into as many as 16 pieces. It would be nice if we could use fragmentated packets in every attack.
if you want to make the WIDS vendors hate you, also match the sequence numbers of the victims
Ad-hoc compatibility?
Intelligent AuthDOS with Shared Key Auth
SSID Bruteforce: Read Wordlist from stdin
CTS control frame flooding

BUGS:
- ZC says: standard auth dos stops after the first 500 and doesnt find another AP
- SSID Bruteforce reported to not work anymore with osdep!
- standard auth dos should go up to 600 instead of 500 (because 512 kills a lot of people)


EAP attacks:

802.1X EAP-Failure
Observing a valid 802.1X EAP exchange, and then sending the station a forged EAP-Failure message.

802.1X EAP-of-Death
Sending a malformed 802.1X EAP Identity response known to cause some APs to crash.

802.1X EAP Length Attacks
Sending EAP type-specific messages with bad length fields to try to crash an AP or RADIUS server.
